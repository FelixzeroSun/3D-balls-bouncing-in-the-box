Once paste codes to Processing, you can just simply click the 'run' bottom to implement the 3D animation.

1. Click the screen inside the box to shot the balls, and one clicking is corresponding one ball shooting.
2. The spining of each ball is related to each velocity along corresponding axises
3. The ball will shot with random x,y direction but with initial speed along z axis 5 .

I successfully implement details when collision between balls and walls
